                    <p class="details-paragraph">A baby hippopotamus is causing a fan frenzy in Thailand.</p>
                    <p class="details-paragraph">Moo Deng - a name that roughly translates to "bouncy pig" - is a two-month-old female pygmy hippo that is going viral online and attracting queues at a zoo near the city of Pattaya.</p>
                    <p class="details-paragraph">Visitor numbers have doubled since her birth in July, according to Khao Kheow Open Zoo.</p>
                    <p class="details-paragraph">But the zoo's director has urged people to behave when they come to see Moo Deng, after videos emerged showing visitors mistreating the animal.</p>

                    <p class="details-paragraph">"These behaviours are not only cruel but also dangerous," Narongwit Chodchoi said in a statement posted online.</p>
                    <p class="details-paragraph">"We must protect these animals and ensure that they have a safe and comfortable environment."</p>
                    <p class="details-paragraph">Videos on social media show some visitors throwing shellfish and even splashing water on Moo Deng to try to coax her out of sleep.</p>
                    <p class="details-paragraph">Mr Narongwit said the zoo has installed CCTV cameras around the enclosures and threatened legal action against those who mistreat the baby hippo.</p>
                    <p class="details-paragraph">The best time to visit Moo Deng is when she is awake, he added.</p>
